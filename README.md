### Developer's thoughts

I really enjoyed making this project and i hope it reaches your expectations.
I learned alot of new concepts and generally had a great time doing it.
There are a few things i would like to improve such as rendering components only after all images are loaded, 
and while loading show a loading screen. Tests should have been done sooner and more thoroughly.
